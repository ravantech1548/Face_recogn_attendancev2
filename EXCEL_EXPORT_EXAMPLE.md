## üí° Tips for Using the Export

### Excel Analysis Tips

1. **Sorting and Filtering**: All sheets support Excel's built-in sort and filter features
2. **Pivot Tables**: Use the Detailed Attendance sheet to create custom pivot tables
3. **Charts**: Create charts from the Staff Summary to visualize team performance
4. **Formulas**: All time values are stored as HH:MM text, but you can convert them for calculations

### Quick Calculations

To calculate total pay based on hours:
```excel
=HOUR(TIME_VALUE(cell)) + MINUTE(TIME_VALUE(cell))/60
```
This converts HH:MM format to decimal hours for calculations.

2. Sort by "Days Worked" to identify absence patterns
3. Sort by "Late Minutes" to identify punctuality issues

**Detailed Investigation:**
1. Open the Detailed Attendance sheet
2. Filter by Staff ID to see one employee's records

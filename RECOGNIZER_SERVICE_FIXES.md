# Face Recognition Service - Stability Fixes

## Problem
The `recognizer_service.py` was quitting unexpectedly when processing continuous images for face detection, likely due to:
- Memory leaks from unmanaged image data
- Database connection issues
- Insufficient error handling
- Resource exhaustion
- Flask development server limitations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Memory Management
- **Resource Cleanup**: Added explicit cleanup of PIL images and numpy arrays after processing
- **Garbage Collection**: Implemented `cleanup_resources()` function with garbage collection
- **Memory Tracking**: Added proper deletion of large objects in `finally` blocks

### 2. Database Connection Pooling
- **Connection Pool**: Replaced individual connections with `psycopg2.pool.ThreadedConnectionPool`
- **Context Manager**: Implemented `get_db_conn()` context manager for automatic connection cleanup
- **Connection Limits**: Configurable min/max connections to prevent resource exhaustion

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added structured logging with different levels
- **Exception Tracking**: Added stack trace logging for better debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Service continues running even if some operations fail
- **Request Timeout**: Added proper timeout handling

### 4. Production-Ready Server
- **Gunicorn Support**: Added production WSGI server option
- **Threading**: Enabled proper threading for concurrent requests
- **Worker Management**: Configurable worker processes and connections
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on service termination

### 5. Resource Limits
- **Upload Size Limits**: Configurable maximum file size
- **Request Limits**: Added request timeout and size validation
- **Memory Limits**: Better memory management for continuous processing

## Files Modified

### `python/recognizer_service.py`
- Added connection pooling
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Improved memory management
- Added resource cleanup
- Production-ready server configuration

### `python/start_production.py` (New)
- Production startup script using Gunicorn
- Automatic dependency installation
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Fallback to Flask development server

### `test_continuous_recognition.py` (New)
- Comprehensive testing script
- Continuous request testing
- Memory stability testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Usage

### Development Mode
```bash
cd python
python recognizer_service.py
```

### Production Mode

#### Windows
```bash
# Option 1: Use the Windows-specific production server
cd python
python start_windows_production.py

# Option 2: Use the batch file
start_recognizer_windows.bat
```

#### Linux/Mac
```bash
cd python
python start_production.py
```

### Testing
```bash
python test_continuous_recognition.py
```

## Configuration

The service now uses enhanced configuration with:
- Database connection pooling settings
- Memory management options
- Logging configuration
- Upload size limits
- Request timeout settings

## Key Improvements

1. **Stability**: Service no longer crashes during continuous processing
2. **Memory**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
3. **Performance**: Connection pooling improves database performance
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging for better debugging
5. **Scalability**: Production-ready server supports more concurrent requests

## Monitoring

Check the logs for:
- Memory usage patterns
- Database connection status
- Request processing times
- Error rates and types

The service now includes comprehensive logging to help identify any remaining issues.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the continuous test script to verify stability
2. Monitor memory usage during extended operation
3. Test with various image sizes and formats
4. Verify database connection pool behavior
5. Test graceful shutdown and restart

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check the logs for specific error messages
2. Monitor system resources (memory, CPU)
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Test with smaller batch sizes
5. Consider adjusting connection pool settings

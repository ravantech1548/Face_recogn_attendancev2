## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

**File**: `backend/src/routes/attendance.js`

The export endpoint (`/api/attendance/export`) has been enhanced with:

1. **Helper Functions**:
   - `hhmmToDecimal()`: Converts HH:MM format to decimal hours for calculations
   - `decimalToHHMM()`: Converts decimal hours back to HH:MM format for display

2. **Summary Calculations**:
   - Overall statistics are calculated by aggregating all attendance records
   - Individual staff summaries are built by grouping records by staff_id
   - All time calculations respect the existing business logic (8-hour regular day, break time deductions)

3. **Excel Generation**:
   - Uses the `xlsx` package to create multi-sheet workbooks
   - Each sheet is created with appropriate column headers
   - Data is formatted for readability in Excel
